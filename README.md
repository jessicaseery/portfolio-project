# Jessica Seery - My personal web-development portfolio

For this Concordia University Bootcamp project, I created a 6 page protfolio website containing several of my previous assignements!

## currently working on
- making some pages render properly on different media formats

## things to add
- loading status
- dark mode
- french and english version
- work qualities about me

## what I have accomplished so far
- creating all the components
- adding content to pages

## thought process
- React Router, Routes, and Route to link all the components --> to link all my pages together I decided to use the clasic Route techniques as I am more familiar with these and greatly love using component routes to link together my work
- since the images weren't rendering I had to import them at the top of the appropriate component file. This really simplified adding images to my website!
- Desktop first approach, it took quite a long time but i made sure each aspect of my website would be properly rendered on any device that views my website.
