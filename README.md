React Router, Routes, and Route to link all the components --> to link all my pages together I decided to use the clasic Route techniques as I am more familiar with these and greatly love using component routes to link together my work

# images

since the images weren't rendering I had to import them at the top of the appropriate component file. This really simplified adding images to my website!
