# Jessica Seery - My personal web-development portfolio

For this Concordia University Bootcamp project, I created a 6 page protfolio website containing several of my previous assignements!

## currently working on
- making some pages render properly on different media formats
- adding content to pages
- adding animations

## things i'd like to add
- loading status
- dark mode
- french and english version
- work qualities about me
- pictures of my life

## what I have accomplished so far
- creating all the components
- adding content to pages
- adding a background on all the pages
- text animation for my name on the first page

## thought process
- React Router, Routes, and Route to link all the components --> to link all my pages together I decided to use the clasic Route techniques as I am more familiar with these and greatly love using component routes to link together my work
- since the images weren't rendering I had to import them at the top of the appropriate component file. This really simplified adding images to my website!
- Desktop first approach, it took quite a long time but I made sure each aspect of my website would be properly rendered on any device that views my website.
- I decided to change the navigation menu to one that shows only if the user clicks on the hamburger icon. Once the user clicks on it the navigation menu will appear and the user will be able to navigate through pages or close the navigation bar to their liking
- Created a data.js file to contain a variety of src links, ids and other information to call each desired item through .map() on their respective components
